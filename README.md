# VOLcanoes Thermal Application for GEP (VOLTAGE)

The VOLcanoes Thermal Application for GEP (VOLTAGE) pilot will analyse the existing or near to be consolidated processing chains suitable for added value product generation, starting from EO optical data, and then select one end-to-end processing chain for pre-operations implementation, adapted for new EO missions such as Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2.
